Introduction to working with Positional Data - Using RoboCup 2D Simulation Data

Uses the RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulation XY Data to visualize the game of Football (soccer).

The data used in the notebook is the groundtruth.csv file, which is a 10 minute example game between Gliders2016 and HELIOS2016, winner and runner up of RoboCup 2016.
You may have to change the directory from which to load the csv file if you download the notebook.
